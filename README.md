## Getting started

### Introduction 

Hi!
this is a apartment scrapper site that will help people found an apartment. With this script you can add criteria and it will generate URL that you can send to yourself via Sendgrid. It's build with Koa & Typescipt starter. 

### What is KOA?

Koa is a new web framework designed by the team behind Express, which aims to be a smaller, more expressive, and more robust foundation for web applications and APIs. By leveraging async functions, Koa allows you to ditch callbacks and greatly increase error-handling. Koa does not bundle any middleware within its core, and it provides an elegant suite of methods that make writing servers fast and enjoyable.
